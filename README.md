### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Software engineer from Indonesia, For me life is a long journey, with problems to solve, lessons to learn, and experiences to enjoy. I'm an experimental kind a guy, instead of dwelling on long discussion of what will, and will not happen, I would do a little probe here and there and see what really happen.
