### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Software engineer from Indonesia, I believe life is a long journey with problems to solve, lessons to learn, but most of all, experiences to enjoy. I'm an experimental kind a guy, instead of dwelling on long discussion of what will, and will not happen, I would do a little probe here and there and see what really happen.
